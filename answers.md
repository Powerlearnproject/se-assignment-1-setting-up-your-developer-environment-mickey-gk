TASK: SETTING UP MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.            date: 18th June 2024


CHOSING AN OPERATION SYSTEM(OS)
My laptop runs on a 64-bit operation system with windows 10 professional installed. But due to its achitecture not meeting the requirements to run windows 11, i.e., not supporting TRM 2.0 and its processor not being supported by windows 11, I couldn't install it.
# the image in the link below shows why I could not install windows 11.

SETTING UP MY IDE( INTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT).
The IDE I chose for my software programmming work was Visual Studio Code(user edition). It is quite easy to download, install and set it up to run.
    1.  downloading the file: - navigate to your browser window and type the following url
        https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.
    2. click on download visual studio code for windows.
    3. after the download is done, run the file by clicking on it to inititate the package installation.
    4. by default, visual studio will install in "C:\Users\PC\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code" path.

INSTALLING VERSION CONTROL (GIT)  and Github
I used git as my version control tool. To install git, I downloaded it from this site:  https://git-scm.com/download/win
I tested if its working correct by running the git bash, gui and cmd.
The link to my git hub account for repository and assignment submission is as follows: https://github.com/mickey-gk

INSTALLING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND RUNTIMES.
As i was going to use python as my basic programming language for my software engineering journey. I downloaded and installed it from:  http://www.python.org
I added its path to my global user environmnmental variable in order for it to run in my commnad lines.
After installing python, I installed its package manager with pip.

CHALLENGES FACED DURING SET UP.
1. Unfamiliarity with the tools and development software resulted in much time taken on doing the set up. I was completed all the installation as it was required at the end.
